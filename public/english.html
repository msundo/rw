			<h2 class="center">The healing</h2>
			<p>Soul-Healing is a powerful and efficient tool, which transforms energy blockages and old patterns that no longer serve us. This kind of healing happens on soul level and uses information from the Akashic records.</p>
			<p class="highlight">The Akashic records are the field in which all information that has ever been known and all thoughts that have ever been thought leaves an impression. It’s a kind of mass consciousness where all information about all universes is stored. Each time you use your intuition, you receive information from here.</p>
			<p>I have been trained to work in these records, and have been given specific guides who assist me in finding the relevant data. An Akashic guide is a kind of entity who protects the archive and also functions as a kind of librarian. I receive the information as symbols, pictures, feelings and words, which enables me to read and understand it.</p>
			<p>This makes it possible to receive information about deeply buried energy blockages which we carry with us, often originating from our past lives. These imbalances typically arise because of traumatic experiences which often create negative patterns of thought and behavior (survival mechanisms). The longer we carry them with us, the heavier they become, and the more imbalance they create. These patterns can be tough to get rid of without any help.</p>
			<p class="highlight">As general psychology states, negative patterns wish to be acknowledged and understood before a transformation can occur. When originating from past life experiences, it can be difficult to become aware of them.</p>
			<p>This is why it’s very efficient to work with the Akashic records. They give us access to information which help us shed light upon the underlying mechanisms that control us, gain insight into how they came to be and understand why we act the way we do. At the same time, I can make sure the blockages are transformed and healed, allowing the soul to restore its balance and reclaim its lost power.</p>

			<h2 class="center">The session</h2>
			<p>The Akashic records exist on another plane, outside our time and space. This is where the healing happens, and therefore it doesn’t matter where you physically are in relation to me. Nor is it crucial when I do the actual work. All that is required is that you give me your permission to make a transformation and that I have the opportunity to share the information with you after. I do the work in advance, because I need deep concentration and can easily spend a couple of hours on it.</p>
			<p class="highlight">Together with my guides, I uncover and transform your energy blockages and imbalances. I often get an insight into past lives where the experiences originate from. I also often receive messages that I will pass on to you.</p>
			<p>Afterwards we agree on a time for the session, where we can talk it through. It can either be face to face, or it can take place over Messenger, Whatsapp or Skype. All sessions are individual and vary in length and content, but it usually takes about an hour's time.</p>
			<p>After a session you can experience after-effects. These can be experienced very differently depending on how sensitive you are, what types of blockages you’ve had and how long you have carried them. Many experience a great relief, increased energy and greater inspiration. Some get tired and need to rest.</p>
			<p class="highlight">You may experience old patterns reappearing while they are being dissolved and leaving your system.</p>
			<p>Other symptoms may be temporary illness as a form of cleansing. Some notice a change already when the session is booked. It may also be that you do not really notice anything until some time has passed and you look back at how things have changed since the session.</p>

					<p>It was very powerful, rewarding and loving at the same time. Although I would have difficulty explaining it to a skeptic, it made sense and made things fall into place. I'm already looking forward to the continued healing and all that follows.</p>

					<p>On October 24th 2018, I received my Akashic healing from Runa. I have to say that all the pictures she had received about my previous situation just hit the spot.</p>
					<p>Runa had, among other things, been told that I lacked three essential soulfacets:
						<ul class="no-margin">
							<li>Selfworth</li>
							<li>Emotional freedom</li>
							<li>Physical security</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p>She could also tell me where and how I had lost them. It made a lot of sense. Here's what I can see now that I've gotten to know what I've lacked:
						<ul>
							<li>I have always, as far as I remember in this life, suppressed my own needs and wishes if they came in the way of others, as I had a basic perception that I was put in the world for the sake of others - not for my own. And this perception, I felt, was confirmed by environmental reactions to me. It is one of the universe's laws that you get what you expect.</li>
							<li>It has always been important for me to show great restraint. Throughout life I have had many great sorrows and concerns, but I have never allowed myself to react to them. Actually, it has been the same with the great pleasures, I have not been able to express them. I have therefore accumulated a lot of unprocessed emotions, both positive and negative.</li>
							<li>I have a high pain threshold and therefore always had a tendency to ignore my body's signals that something was wrong. It may also be a bit associated with the lack of self-worth. It's not so important that I'm doing well... I just have to bite my teeth and keep going.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p>Now 3½ weeks have passed, so I can say something about how it worked, both right after the session and in the time after. Immediately after the session, I felt a little "high" and very liberated. Maybe it's the first time in my life, I've ever felt truly "seen". The healing has, however, also initiated a cleansing process that has been / is a bit tough but also necessary in order to move on. </p>
					<p>In regard to the 3 points:
						<ul>
							<li>Both myself and my surroundings need to get used to me thinking of myself and no longer just automatically keeping within my old "role of service". Now I too want something out of life. I want to focus on the things that make me happy and spend more time on them.</li>
							<li>Old feelings have been tumbling over me. Therefore, I have (but as usual in private) been crying, but also had outbreaks of joy. Fortunately, I drive about 75 minutes alone in my car to and from my workplace every day. There I can sing freely without bothering anyone, and I also have a storage of napkins to dry the tears. I can have long conversations with myself and put into words old sorrows, pleasures, trauma and anxiety cases to get them out of my system.</li>
							<li>I have become aware of what my body tells me so I have an opportunity to do something about the problems.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p>I am fully aware that my process has only just begun and it takes time to deal with the thought patterns that I have had for 58 years. I am deeply grateful that Runa has conveyed the healing and made me aware of what has restricted me till now. This way I have the opportunity to make the rest of my life more festive for myself - and also for my surroundings. Thank you.</p>

					<p>Even though I’m what you would call a skeptic of “alternative healing”, I agreed to try the session, as I felt that any loving act could only benefit my situation. Runa's healing gave me a surprising and very meaningful insight into the issues that has taken up a lot of my energy lately. I was shocked by how many of the pictures she described of the blockages I recognized.</p>
					<p>I experienced a very touching conversation with Runa after the session, and was impressed by the actual healing and her approach to the matter. She approaches the spiritual almost like science, and turns something that seems otherwise intangible into something very understandable and accessible.</p>
					<p>I would recommend Runa's healing to anyone who wants to get to know themselves better or anyone who experiences a trail of similar issues that does not resolve. After the healing, I feel like a new chapter has begun, and my husband and I have even finally become pregnant - after having tried for 4 years without success.</p>

					<p>The session was extremely exciting. There was nothing I could not recognize. The issues that were addressed were completely precise and gave me a much better understanding of them through new perspectives. To have another person "read" one's soul in such a way, is completely unique, and you feel understood and truly "seen." That's something everyone deeply longs for, I think. I have already felt great changes in my life and in my consciousness. Positive ripple effects begins after such a session, no doubt. Good thing it doesn’t have to be only this one session. At least I would love to try more in the future. Thank you very much, Runa!</p>

					<p>Soul-Healing has changed my life in an inexplicable way... It's an indescribable experience to receive this kind of healing. It wasn’t long before I felt a relief in my soul. Runa has been really great at explaining what it's all about and her warm heart has made the whole session an amazing experience. I can definitely recommend Soul-Healing.</p>

					<p>My experience with Runa’s Akashic healing was really lovely and pleasant, and very uplifting. Runa was good at drawing and telling, as well as listening and understanding. Everything she said made a lot of sense, I could easily recognize myself in what she told me. Both right before the session and afterwards I have been ill, so there is or has certainly been a healing in progress. And as Runa said, the old patterns could reappear before being dissolved, that's what I'm going through now. It's good to know, because this way I know it's going forward and progress is taking place.</p>
					<p>I'm sure the session will make a difference, it has given me great inspiration and courage to continue my journey to a fearless, bold, strong and free life. Thank you Dear Runa, it was a wonderful and lovely experience, I would highly recommend it to others.</p>

			<h2 class="center">About me</h2>
			<img class="about__image" src="assets/images/runa2-small.jpg"/>
			<p>My name is Runa Wilhelmina Marrable and I was born in 1983. Originally I'm from Norway and after traveling and moving around for a couple of years, I ended up settling down in Copenhagen in 2004. I'm married to Michael and mother of little Elvin.</p>
			<p>I am educated within Soul-Healing, Reiki and Inka Healing, and I am trained in working with the Akashic records. I also have a 2.5 year education as a Life Counselor with focus on psychotherapy.</p>
			<p>Over the years, I have received many different forms of healing to explore and experience on my own body. Soul-Healing is by far the most powerful form of healing I have tried. My encounter with this method came after I had worked with personal and spiritual development for many years. In spite of a lot of dedicated work, there were some areas where I continued to feel like I kept hitting my head against the wall. There were negative patterns I just could not get rid of, no matter how much I tried. That's why it made such a big impression on me when I had a huge Aha moment from just one Soul-Healing session. In the time that followed, there were small but noticeable changes in the way I related to myself and my surroundings. And bit by bit I had changed my whole life.</p>
			<p>I have since received Soul-Healing on several occasions, and each time I’ve gained a deeper understanding and catharsis which ha helped me take a big step forward in my development.</p>
			<p>It is a great gift to be able to work with this method. To have others showing me their trust and allowing me to help, makes me deeply touched and grateful.</p>
			<p>The fact that we can create such positive changes together is incredibly inspiring.</p>
